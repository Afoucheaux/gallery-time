I was on track to graduate early, and had a scholarship that covered almost HALF of my tuition, and even then it wasn't worth attending this worthless school. Everyday I came into contact with uneducated and disrespectful teachers, and peers at an elementary school art-level. The educational standards at this school are astoundingly low, recovering topics I learned in second grade public school, such as \"the definition of a research paper.\" When expressing my desire for a more stimulating educational experience, I was met with backlash and punishment for being ahead of the curve. When I decided to drop out, they tried SCAMMING me for thousands of dollars. They attempted to retroactively removing my scholarship after I dropped out, which was nowhere to be found in the scholarship agreements. My family had to submit an appeal for this choice, and we were luckily able to avoid this outrageous fine. Perhaps this school would be okay for someone merely looking for a degree, and who has plenty of disposable income to waste. But for anyone wanting a quality education and a positive college experience, this college is not for you.",
